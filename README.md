# Garden Calc: Infinite Expansion

Garden Calc Infinite Expansion is an upgraded version of the Garden Calculator (https://daydun.com/cookie/garden/) originally made by Daydun. It adds several features, including:
- The ability to infinitely expand the garden (you can do so by clicking the plus button next to the level display), which were previously capped at level 9;
- The ability to select and plant plants at its budding, sprouting, blooming, and mature phase, as well as the ability to plant decaying plants; the stats updates accordingly. 
- Now supports Tidygrass and Everdaisy's suppression of weeds and fungus.
- The ability to import, export, custom resize, and capture garden.
- The expansion of the stats from 2 digits of precision to 7.

Originally made as a mod.
